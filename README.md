## Project Overview
Title: Retail Sales Analysis
Level: Beginner-Friendly
Database: p1_retail_db

This project highlights the use of SQL for analyzing retail transactions in a structured way. The goal is to practice core SQL skills used by data analysts — from creating databases and cleaning raw data, to performing exploratory analysis and solving real business problems. Through this project, learners can gain hands-on experience with SQL queries that provide insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.

## Objectives
1. Database Creation – Build and organize a sales database.
2. Data Cleaning – Handle missing or invalid records for accuracy.
3. Exploratory Analysis – Perform quick checks on sales volume, customers, and categories.
4. Business Queries – Solve practical questions like sales by category, top customers, seasonal trends, and sales by time of day.


## Project Highlights
Designed a retail sales table with attributes like transaction details, customer demographics, product categories, quantity, and sales values.
Cleaned data by removing nulls and ensuring reliable results.
Used SQL queries to analyze revenue by category, identify high-value transactions, calculate customer averages, and detect top spenders.
Applied grouping and ranking to find monthly trends and best-selling periods.
Segmented transactions into time-based shifts (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) for better understanding of buying patterns.


## Insights
Customer Behavior – Age and gender distribution across product categories.
Revenue Trends – Category-wise sales, peak months, and high-value orders.
Top Buyers – Identified loyal and premium customers.
Sales Shifts – Observed when customers are most active during the day.


## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical introduction to SQL for anyone starting in data analytics. It demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into meaningful insights that help businesses make data-driven decisions.
